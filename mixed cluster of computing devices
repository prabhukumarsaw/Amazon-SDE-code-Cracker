Your team at Amazon is working on a system that divides applications to a mixed cluster of computing devices. Each application is identified by an integer ID,
requires a fixed non-zero amount of memory to execute, and is defined to be either a foreground or background application. IDs are guaranteed to be unique within 
their own application type, but not across types. Each device should be assigned two applications at once, one foreground application and one background application. 
Devices have limited amounts of memory and cannot execute applications that require more memory than the available memory. 
The goal of the system is to maximize the total utilization of the memory of a given device. A foreground/background application pair 
is considered to be optimal if there does not exist another pair that uses more memory than this pair, and also has a total less than or equal
to the total memory of the device. For example, if the device has 10MB memory, a foreground/background pair using a sum total of 9MB memory would be optimal 
if there does not exist a pair that uses a sum total of 10 MB, but would not be optimal if such a pair did exist Write an algorithm to find the sets of foreground
